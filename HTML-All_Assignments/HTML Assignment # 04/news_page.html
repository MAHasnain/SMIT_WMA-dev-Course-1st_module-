        The announcement came as the premier met with Azerbaijan’s President
        Ilham Aliyev in Baku, where he had arrived yesterday on a two-day
        official visit. Pakistan and Azerbaijan enjoy a long-standing bond of
        brotherhood, underpinned by shared values and common aspirations. PM
        Shehbaz’s visit underscores the commitment of both nations to deepening
        bilateral ties, enhancing economic cooperation and fostering regional
        collaboration. “Pakistan and Azerbaijan have decided to enhance the
        scope of bilateral investment up to $2bn in areas of mutually beneficial
        projects,” the report stated, adding that the decision was made during
        their talks between the two leaders.

        The second in its series, Exercise Sea Guard is a Pakistan Navy
        initiative aimed at bringing together representatives from the country’s
        diverse maritime sectors, including shipping, fisheries, law enforcement
        agencies, private entities, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs)
        under one platform to collectively address multifaceted challenges in
        the maritime domain. “During the opening brief, participants were
        apprised of the aims and objectives of Exercise Sea Guard, as well as
        the critical role of the Joint Maritime Information Coordination Centre
        (JMICC) in ensuring maritime safety and security along Pakistan’s
        coastline,” the statement said. It added that the exercise sought to
        enhance coordination among national stakeholders while operating within
        their respective legal frameworks, using JMICC as a common platform to
        strengthen the security of Pakistan’s maritime zones. “It includes a
        series of practical scenario-based exercises at sea, along with
        table-top discussions, to refine and improve existing security
        mechanisms,” it said. Representatives from sectors such as Pakistan
        Maritime Security Agency, Pakistan National Coast Guards, Pakistan
        National Shipping Corporation, Anti-Narcotics Force, Federal
        Investigation Agency, Karachi Port Trust, and Port Qasim Authority
        attended the event as well. Commander Coast, Rear Admiral Faisal Amin
        acknowledged all the national stakeholders for their efforts to promote
        a safer maritime environment. Earlier this month, the ninth
        Multinational Maritime Exercise Aman-25 was held at the Pakistan Navy’s
        Fleet Headquarters Auditorium, with participation from 60 nations. On
        Feb 10, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif , while speaking during a ceremony
        organised by the Pakistan Navy, had said that changes taking place at
        the global level have had an impact on all sectors. In this era of
        globalisation, the role of maritime security has further increased, he
        added.
