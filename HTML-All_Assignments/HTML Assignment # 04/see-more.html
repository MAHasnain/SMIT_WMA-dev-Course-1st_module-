          Afghanistan’s internal power struggles matter to both Pakistan and
          Kabul’s other neighbours, as well as the larger international
          community, because if the current dispensation implodes, it may fuel a
          fresh humanitarian exodus, along with empowering transnational
          terrorist groups based in that country.

        THERE are concerning reports of possible divisions within the Afghan
        Taliban, particularly between the ideological old guard based in
        Kandahar, and the more pragmatic members of the hard-line movement. The
        rumours have been given credence as some senior members of the Taliban
        apparently fled Afghanistan after making remarks critical of the
        leadership. This includes deputy foreign minister Abbas Stanikzai, who
        reportedly left in January after criticising Taliban supreme leader
        Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, specifically the latter’s harsh stance on
        girls’ education.

    <h2>US aid suspension to hit 60 health facilities in Pakistan</h2>

          ISLAMABAD: Effects of the suspension of all US foreign aid programmes
          have started to appear in Pakistan as over 60 health facilities will
          be closed down, leaving 1.7 million people, including 1.2m Afghan
          refugees, cut off from life-saving reproductive health services.

      <p>
        These health facilities in Pakistan were being administered by the
        United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The UNFPA’s Regional Director
        for Asia and the Pacific, Pio Smith, expressed his deep concern saying
        that millions of women and girls now face life-threatening risks due to
        the lack of access to UNFPA’s crucial services across Afghanistan,
        Bangladesh and Pakistan. In response to the US administration’s decision
        to pause nearly all US foreign aid programmes pending a 90-day review,
        UNFPA has suspended services funded by US grants that provide a lifeline
        for women and girls in crises, including in South Asia, Pio Smith said.
        “This is not about statistics. This is about real lives. These are
        literally the world’s most vulnerable people,”

        THE Trump administration has halted nearly all US government funding for
        programmes that promote democracy and human rights in many countries, a
        move that experts warn will have significant repercussions for
        Pakistan’s democratic institutions. Pakistan has been one of the largest
        recipients of US development assistance in South Asia. Under these
        programmes, Washington provided between $13 million and $15 million to
        the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to support free and fair
        elections. The funds were allocated for the ‘Strengthening Electoral and
        Legislative Processes’ project, which ran from 2016 to 2023, under the
        supervision of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The
        Trump administration’s broader foreign aid freeze has also impacted
        humanitarian and development assistance, halting $845m in funding for
        Pakistani projects and disrupting 11 governance programmes. In a recent
        interview with a Fox News affiliate in Detroit, Michigan, former
        Pakistani president Arif Alvi claimed that the US Agency for
        International Development (USAID) had given up to $17m to the ECP.
